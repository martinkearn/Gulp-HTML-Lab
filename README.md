# Gulp HTML Lab
A lab that shows how to use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) in conjunction to some of the more with some common Gulp plug-ins such as gulp-cssmin, gulp-uglify and gulp-concat.

The lab is based on a generic, simple 'front end' HTML website with no assumptions on the web server or use of any specfic server-side languages.

We'll use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor, but you can use any editor you like such as Sublime, WebStorm etc (if you have not yet tried [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), why not give it a go, it is new, fast and cross platform).

This lab includes the following tasks.

1. [PC Setup](PCSetup.md)
1. [Building with Gulp](BuildingWithGulp.md)
